# SOW Agent Output (20250817_185558)

### Question:
What process does the Drafting Agent follow before handing the document to the Compliance Agent?

### Answer:
The Drafting Agentâ€™s workflow before handing the document to the Compliance Agent involves the following steps:

1. The Drafting Agent generates the initial content of the SOW based on user inputs and requirements, using a context-aware prompt generation system that transforms user inputs into structured prompts for the language model.
2. The Drafting Agent generates drafts in a structured JSON format, which makes it easier for downstream agents to apply edits, run validations, or convert to final documents.
3. The system uses a hybrid approach that ensures generated content aligns with organizational precedents while adapting to the specific requirements of each new document.
4. The Drafting Agent operates within a coordinated multi-agent architecture, communicating through well-defined interfaces to maintain an integrated workflow with the Compliance Agent and Formatting & Validation Agent.
5. The Drafting Agent leverages advanced natural language processing models and targeted techniques optimized for its specific function, such as GPT-4.1 for drafting.

Once the Drafting Agent has completed these steps, the document is handed over to the Compliance Agent for review and validation. The Compliance Agent checks the document for compliance with legal standards and organization policies, and ensures that the document follows all the important rules.
