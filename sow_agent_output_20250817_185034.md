# SOW Agent Output (20250817_185034)

### Question:
What process does the Drafting Agent follow before handing the document to the Compliance Agent?

### Answer:
The process that the Drafting Agent follows before handing the document to the Compliance Agent involves:

1. Context-aware prompt generation: The Drafting Agent uses a context-aware prompt generation system to transform user inputs into structured prompts for the language model. These prompts include both fixed sections (such as required SOW sections) and dynamic variables (like project goals, timelines, and deliverables).

2. Draft generation: The Drafting Agent generates drafts in a structured JSON format, which makes it easier for downstream agents to apply edits, run validations, or convert to final documents.

3. Decoupling of drafting from editing logic: The setup allows for the decoupling of drafting from editing logic, simplifying prompt management and ensuring reproducible outputs during testing and review.

4. Alignment with organizational precedents: The Drafting Agent's hybrid approach ensures that generated content aligns with organizational precedents while adapting to the specific requirements of each new document.

Once the Drafting Agent completes these steps, the document is handed over to the Compliance Agent, which checks and improves it based on legal needs. This collaborative approach ensures that every SOW is compliant with legal standards and organizational policies.
